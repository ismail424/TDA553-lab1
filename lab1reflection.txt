1.Explain how you chose the inheritance hierarchy in Task 1, making reference to the Open-Closed Principle.
The inheritance hierarchy in Task 1 was chosen by considering the Open-Closed Principle. The Open-Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that the class should be able to be extended without having to modify the class itself. 

2.Explain how you implemented each of the sanity checks in Task 4?

First we created some test cases for each of the sanity checks that we wanted to implement. We then created a method for each of the sanity checks and used the test cases to check if the method was working correctly.

Example of a test:
If the user brakes the car, the speed should decrease by the brake argument. If the brake argument is equal to 1, the speed should be 0.

Then we tested the code to see if the test cases passed. 
Some of the test cases failed, so we modified the code to make the test cases pass.
